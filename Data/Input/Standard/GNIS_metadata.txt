  Description:
    Abstract: The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) actively seeks data from and partnerships with Government agencies at all levels and other interested organizations. The GNIS is the Federal standard for geographic nomenclature. The U.S. Geological Survey developed the GNIS for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a Federal inter-agency body chartered by public law to maintain uniform feature name usage throughout the Government and to promulgate standard names to the public. The GNIS is the official repository of domestic geographic names data; the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government; and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products of all types. See http://geonames.usgs.gov for additional information.
    Purpose: The Geographic Names Information System contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries. The database assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. The GNIS collects data from a broad program of partnerships with Federal, State, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The GNIS provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map and feature services, file download services, and customized files upon request.
    Supplemental_Information: The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was created in 1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to establish and maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. The Board serves all government agencies and the public as the central authority to which name inquiries, name issues, and new name proposals can be directed. It is comprised of representatives of Federal agencies associated with land management and cartography. Sharing its responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board develops principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of both domestic and foreign geographic names as well as undersea and Antarctic feature names.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: During Phase I data compilation, a random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were visually verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS topographic maps) to ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95%. Subsequent data compilation and input processes ensure accuracy with programmed validation checks for format and content, visual examination, and spot checks of data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: During Phase I data compilation, a random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were visually verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS topographic maps) to ensure logical consistency of locative references (geographic coordinates, topographic map, and county. Subsequent data compilation and input processes include programmed validation checks for logical consistency, visual examination, and spot checks of data.
  Completeness_Report: This dataset contains information about United States physical and cultural geographic features of all types and classes, with the exception of most roads and highways. Subsequent to the original data compilation process, which was taken primarily from Federal maps, the GNIS has become dependent on input from Federal, State, county, and local government agencies and other approved sources. The completeness, currency, and accuracy of the data varies by area depending on the quality and timeliness of that input. Accordingly, the Geographic Names Project actively seeks to expand partnerships with Government agencies at all levels and other interested organizations. The latest tools and methodologies are being applied, including web map and feature services, and joint or linked web applications, to ensure that local data are properly represented in the GNIS and through the GNIS to all Federal agencies and to the public. Feature additions or corrections are accepted for consideration from any source, and when validated by appropriate agencies, will be entered into the database. Local and State agencies are encouraged to submit data and to participate in the GNIS partnership program. Non-government organizations with valuable data are considered on a case basis. Authorized partners have access to web based transaction entry and edit forms, which submit data directly to the GNIS for review and inclusion in the database. Partners also submit batch files in most standard formats, and coordinate with the Geographic Names Project to develop joint services, processes, and applications for greatest efficiency. Data entered into the GNIS immediately is available to all web services and applications dependent on it. For additional information or to request user accounts for entry and edit of production data and web seminar training, contact gnis_manager@usgs.gov. 
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of these digital data is based upon the use of printed or electronic source graphics which are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. Comparison to the graphic source is used as control to assess digital positional accuracy.

  Detailed_Description:
    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: Geographic feature
      Entity_Type_Definition: A geographic feature is any relatively permanent part of the natural or manmade landscape or seascape that has recognizable identity within a particular cultural context. The primary attributes of a geographic feature are name and location.
      Entity_Type_Definition_Source: Principles, Policies, and Procedures: Domestic Geographic Names, By Donald J. Orth, Executive Secretary, Domestic Geographic Names (emeritus) and Roger L. Payne, Executive Secretary, United States Board on Geographic Names and Domestic Geographic Names, Third printing (revised) and Preliminary Online Edition, 1997 (http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/pro_pol_pro.pdf).
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Feature Identifier
      Attribute_Definition: A permanent, unique number assigned to a geographic feature for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying that feature as a record in any information system database, dataset, file, or document and for distinguishing it from all other feature records so identified. The number is assigned sequentially (highest existing number plus one) to new records as they are created in the Geographic Names Information System. The number, by design, carries no information or association to the content of the feature record and therefore is not subject to change as attribute values change. Once assigned to a feature, the number is never changed or withdrawn, and never reassigned. The Feature ID can be applied in conjunction with system-unique record identifiers in any database or system, thus providing a national standard common reference identifier across multiple datasets.

      Attribute_Label: Feature Name
      Attribute_Definition: A geographic feature name and its written form and application approved or recognized as official by the United States Board on Geographic Names for use throughout the Federal Government. The official name is established either by policy or by decision of the Board on Geographic Names. It is the proper name, specific term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is, or was, known. A geographic feature may have only one official name, which must be the name applied to the feature on all Federal products, electronic or printed.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Primary Point
      Attribute_Definition: The official feature location is a single point to which the official feature name is associated in order to ensure positive and unique identification and association, also referred to as the primary point. The location is determined by the authoritative source and is approved or recognized as official by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names by decision or by policy delegation to the authoritative source. The placing of the location point is governed by policies of the Board as defined in the Names Data Users Guide and GNIS metadata, generally at or near the geographic center, but there are exceptions for certain classes of features. For example, the official feature location of flowing bodies of water (streams, rivers, creeks, etc.) or trending linear features (valleys, gulchs, gullys, hollows, etc.) is at the mouth. A geographic feature may have only one official location regardless of size, extent, composition, structure, or boundaries. The location point is coincident with, but in addition to and independent of, any other geospatial representation or boundary definition that may be attached to the feature in other datasets. Linear and aerial features may have secondary points as defined in the Names Data Users Guide and GNIS metadata. Locations are stored in the Geographic Names Information System as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees to seven places, North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), and are available in geospatial format as needed. (Note: Records showing all zeros for latitude and longitude indicate that the coordinates of the feature are unknown. They are recorded in the database as zeros to satisfy the format requirements of a numerical data type. They are not errors and do not reference the actual geographic coordinates at 0 latitude, 0 longitude.)

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: Secondary Point
      Attribute_Definition: The latitude and longitude of a point locating a linear or areal geographic feature on a map of the USGS National Base Map series (at a scale of 1:24000 or 1:25000) other than the map containing the primary point. With one exception (i.e., the point representing the source of a stream, valley or arroyo may be on the same map as the primary point) a feature is assigned one point per map on which it is located. The points are sequenced. Sequence number one is always the primary point and the remaining points are secondary points. For a linear feature with feature class equal to valley, stream, or arroyo, the points are sequenced from mouth toward the source and the highest sequence number is the source. For other linear features and for areal features, secondary points are sequenced according to guidelines of the U.S. Board On Geographic Names. The location of the point on the feature within the map is arbitrary. This method of associating features with maps was conceived prior to geographic information system technology and has been retained as a useful approximation of feature extent and a reference to printed maps. These points do not represent boundaries or geometries and should not be confused with them. Secondary points are stored in the Geographic Names Information System as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees to seven places, North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), and are available in geospatial format as needed. (Note: Records showing all zeros for latitude and longitude indicate that the coordinates of the feature are unknown. They are recorded in the database as zeros to satisfy the format requirements of a numerical data type. They are not errors and do not reference the actual geographic coordinates at 0 latitude, 0 longitude.)

      Attribute_Label: Feature Class
      Attribute_Definition: A feature class is a designation for a group of features in a broadly defined descriptive category. All features are assigned to one and only one class. They do not individually classify all kinds of cultural and natural features. By design, there are no Federal or industry standards or guidelines for feature classification. These classifications originally were developed for mainframe file structure search purposes. Although the terms are generally consistent with dictionary definitions, they may not conform exactly and are not always intuitive.

      Attribute_Definition: A feature designation is assigned to a feature or group of features to define further and classify feature functions, purpose, and attributes. For example, a feature designated historical is one that once existed but has ceased to exist, is no longer apparent on the landscape, and/or no longer serves its original purpose. Other examples include State Capitol, County Seat, Independent City, and Subdivision. A feature may have more than one designation. Designations and their definitions will be added as needed.

      Attribute_Definition: The elevation above sea level of the feature at the primary point (positive number) or depth of a feature at the lowest point below sea level (negative number). By default, elevations are provided in meters. For custom data extracts, elevations can be provided in either feet or meters depending on user requirements. Elevation figures are not official and do not represent precisely measured or surveyed values. The data are extracted from the National Elevation Dataset (http://ned.usgs.gov/) for the primary coordinates and may differ from elevations cited in other sources. The differences will be most evident for features such as summits where precision is of more concern and where the local relief (rate of change of elevation) may be more prominent. However, the elevation figures are within tolerances for the data for most points and sufficiently accurate for purposes of general information.

To be unique, the Census Code must be preceded by the two-digit State code. The FIPS55 database and data were merged with the Geographic Names Information System. The GNIS Feature ID superseded the Census (Place) Code as the Federal standard unique, permanent, feature identifier and will over time replace it in all Federal systems. Census Codes are retained in the GNIS during the transition, and are viewable and downloadable from the GNIS public web site.

        Format_Information_Content: Primary attributes are available from the GNIS XML service. Instructions: Insert desired parameter value(s) in single quotes following the equals sign. Do not change or delete unused parameters. Parameter definitions: fname = feature name. (Exact match. Not case sensitive.) state = state name. (Exact match. Case sensitive.) cnty = county name. (Exact match. Not case sensitive.) cell = USGS standard topographic map name. (Exact match. Not case sensitive.) ftype = feature type (class). See the GNIS public query page (http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/). The pick list for feature class contains the values. Note that the value (populated place) in the pick list is abbreviated (ppl) in the data. See question 14, How can I acquire GNIS data?, of our FAQ (http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm) for more details and sample URLs. As currently implemented, it is for relatively small data set queries not for mass downloads. It does not include all attributes. Customized files of large data sets also can be provided on request in most standard formats. The data is presented in format XML.
